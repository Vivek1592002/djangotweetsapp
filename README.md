# Django Twitter-Like Application

This project is a lightweight Twitter-like web application developed using the Django framework. It offers users a platform to express themselves through short messages or "tweets" while interacting with other users in a simple, intuitive environment.

## Core Features:

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   Users can easily register for an account and log in to access the platform. The application supports standard Django authentication, ensuring secure login credentials and access control.

2. **Post and Manage Tweets:**
   Once logged in, users can create and post tweets, which will appear on a public timeline visible to all users. Each tweet can consist of short messages, simulating the microblogging style of platforms like Twitter. Users have the flexibility to manage their tweets and are provided the option to delete any of their own tweets when necessary.

3. **Timeline and User Interaction:**
   The application features a timeline that displays all tweets from every user, enabling users to view and engage with content shared by others. While it currently does not include like or comment functionality, the focus is on providing a clean and simple user experience for sharing and consuming content.

4. **Delete Functionality:**
   Users are empowered to delete their own tweets, giving them control over their content. However, each user can only delete the tweets they have authored, ensuring integrity and respect for others' content.

## Purpose:
The project serves as an educational tool and a basic implementation of core Django features like user authentication, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and form handling. It offers a hands-on demonstration of how to build a social media-like platform from scratch using Djangoâ€™s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
